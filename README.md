Caffemodel for final Triplet GoogleNet network: https://goo.gl/NAk8CT  

## Setup
1. MAC OSX
  - Setup caffe using ["All-in-one Docker image for Deep Learning"]. I used dl-docker because it supports iPython notebook and a lot of [other useful tools](https://github.com/saiprashanths/dl-docker/blob/master/README.md#specs), you could use [caffe's docker files](https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/tree/master/docker) or even build caffe on your machine. One caveat is that dl-docker takes roughly 5x more time (~10 minutes) to build compared to caffe's dockerfile, and its image is 3x bigger, 3.6GB vs. 1.38GB of caffe's docker image that contains ubuntu:14.04+basic tools+caffe.

 - To access iPython notebook from the host
 - iPython needs to be run as a public notebook server. This is already configured in the dl-docker image. All that is left to do is to secure the server with a password, instructions are available [here](http://jupyter-notebook.readthedocs.io/en/latest/public_server.html).
 - Additionally, port mapping is required between target and host ports. This can easily be done by passing "-p < host_port_no >:< target_port_no >" as an argument while launching docker container.

	2. The first time you define param {lr_mult=...} is for filters and the second one is for the biases - but how would one understand this? https://github.com/BVLC/caffe/issues/3454
